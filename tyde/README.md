# To do list

- [x] Remove "we" to avoid tutorial-style
- [x] S-expressions: requirements, why, how does Editorable fulfill them
- [x] Application section, describing Hezarfen
- [x] Accessible color scheme
- [x] There should be text after every header (sections, subsections etc)
- [x] Syntax colors for Lisp?
 * JK: I think this is fine for now, we don't have much Lisp anyway.
- [x] Finish the step by step description of primitive Editorable instances
- [x] The universe encoding section in future work
- [ ] Too many footnotes

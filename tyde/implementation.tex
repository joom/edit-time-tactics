\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

\TODO{This section probably won't resemble the one in the thesis, since it should be maximum 1 page for readability}

\TODO{The main goal of this section will be to provide enough information about the implementation so that someone else can add this feature to their dependently typed language. What were the big challenges? Think of things like the need for the local context to be preserved and how that gets associated with commands, as well as document the interesting challenges that arose.}
